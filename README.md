# MovieBoxd #

The goal of the project was to learn the fundementals of web development and API usage.
This was my first attempt at web development, so the website is admittedly quite clunkly and rough around the edges.
However, I gained invaluable experience using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL and working with APIs.

The idea of this website was a basic clone of the website Letterboxd (which I 'creatively called MovieBoxd). 
Users have the ability to view a list of movies and save the ones they like to their watchlist. 
Admins have the ability to pull movies from the movie API and add it to the list that normal users can access.

I encourage you to have a look for [yourself](https://it202-jd755-prod-028c8689138c.herokuapp.com/Project/login.php)!
